Instead of calling people bad or wrong or evil, what if you saw them for what they really are? Limited. A person can only act from the level of consciousness they stand on. They cannot reach higher than their awareness allows. When you begin to see this, judgment fades. Their cruelty no longer feels personal. Their words no longer pierce the same way. Because you realize they are only reflecting the walls of their own mind. And here's the truth. The more your consciousness expands, the less fault you find in others. Forgiveness doesn't mean they were right. It means you refuse to chain yourself to their limits. That's real freedom. Not to excuse, not to forget, but to see through. To understand that nothing weakens you more than hate. And nothing elevates you more than understanding.
